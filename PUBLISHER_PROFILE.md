**About Me:**

I'm a software engineer passionate about improving developer productivity through better tooling and automation. I believe that great development experiences come from intelligent features like enhanced IntelliSense and smart automation that eliminate repetitive tasks. 

My extensions focus on streamlining common workflows, reducing context switching, and helping developers write code faster and with more confidence. I create tools that I use daily in my own work, solving real problems that I encounter in modern web development.

**Philosophy:**
- Automate the routine, focus on the creative
- Build IntelliSense that feels like magic
- Make navigation effortless and intuitive
- Improve productivity one keystroke at a time
